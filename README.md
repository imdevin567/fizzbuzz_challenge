#FizzBuzz Challenge

This is a personal project that I am doing to learn the basics of many different programming languages. I plan to implement the traditional "FizzBuzz" program in as many languages I can before I get bored.

##Rules

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
